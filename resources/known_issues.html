<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE: There is currently one major issue with the mod: Animals/mobs do not recognize to custom gates as obstructions and will be unnaturally attracted to them.</p>

<p>NOTICE: vanilla fences, such as the oak fence and nether brick fence, will not connect to the fences or fence gates in this mod. This is due to the way vanilla fences decide where to connect and I haven't found a workaround yet.</p>
